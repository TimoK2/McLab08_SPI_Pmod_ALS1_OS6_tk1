The code is developed for the hardware NUCLEO-L432KC or any other board
with SPI communication and the Digilent Pmod ALS1 ambient light sensor module.
The purpose is to make students to understand the development process. 
They need to study the original analog to digital converter documentation for 
the Texas Instruments ADC081S021 to understand how the converter 16 bit output 
is converted to an illuminance value.
